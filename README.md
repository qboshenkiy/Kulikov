# Django Project Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up and running a Django project.

## Prerequisites
- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- pip (Python package installer)
- Virtualenv (recommended)

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository from GitHub:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
cd yourproject
```

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment
Create and activate a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Set Up the Database
Run the following commands to apply migrations and set up the database:
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### Step 5: Create a Superuser
Create a superuser account to access the Django admin interface:
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Follow the prompts to set up your superuser account.

### Step 6: Run the Development Server
Start the Django development server:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
The project will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Additional Setup

### Static Files
To collect all static files into one directory (for production):
```
python manage.py collectstatic
```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file to store environment-specific variables (optional but recommended):
```
DEBUG=on
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
```
Ensure you load these variables in your settings.

## Testing
Run tests to ensure everything is working correctly:
```
python manage.py test
```

## Deployment
For deploying the project to a production server, additional steps are required:
- Set `DEBUG = False` in your settings
- Configure a production-ready database
- Set up a web server (e.g., Gunicorn) and a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx)
- Use a secure method to manage environment variables

## Conclusion
Your Django project should now be up and running. For more details, refer to the official [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/).
